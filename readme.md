# Conversational AI with PDF Question Answering, Summarization & Chat

This project is a **LangChain-powered Conversational AI** that can:
- **Answer questions** from PDFs using semantic search.
- **Summarize** document contents.
- **Engage in free-form conversation** with memory of the last few interactions.

It uses **Google Generative AI (Gemini)** for language understanding and embeddings, with **FAISS** as a local vector database.
